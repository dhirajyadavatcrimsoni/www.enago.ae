Although the material was quite good, the writing was disjointed.  I treated it as a &quot;puzzle,&quot; and moved around or deleted sections within each chapter until it made sense.  The author was amazed.  She'd done the actual writing, but she was shocked by how much sharper the manuscript was with some restructuring.  Ever since I first took Latin in high school and realized that language could have the quality of a puzzle, I've been drawn to working with language in various ways.</td>

I lived in West Berlin in 1973, and became interested in the German language and in literature after that experience.   I can't really say why, but I was fascinated by the whole period between World War I and World War II.  There was a lot of cultural ferment in Europe at that time, and many modernist trends were emerging.  I always thought I would have liked to live in Europe then.  It was a time that really tested people, too, in many ways, and I often wondered if I could have met some of those challenges.</td>

So I think Google will be the primary beneficiary, not &quot;readers.&quot;  I might be somewhat more sympathetic to their aims if I hadn't found my own book on Google Books.  It appeared there without my knowledge.  Neither Google nor the publisher asked my permission to digitize the book.  Also, as someone who has taught college students, it's difficult to get across that these aren't actually books (pages are missing) that can be cited in research papers.  I personally like books I can hold in my hands.</td>

The author had sketched out a plan to write a quartet of novels about the interwar years in France and the Occupation.  She only finished two books before she was deported to Auschwitz, where she died.  This book was found 64 years later.    I also love many contemporary authors who treat multicultural themes.  I'm so intrigued by the globalization of our world today.</td>

This isn't to say anyone should &quot;copy&quot; another author's work, but rather that these models can give an author a good sense of how to organize and present one's ideas.  Aside from common grammatical errors, what I've noticed most often is that some authors seem unaware of the expectations for scholarly writing and unaware of the needs of their potential readers.  They should always try to imagine themselves in their readers' place and try to write from that perspective.</td>
