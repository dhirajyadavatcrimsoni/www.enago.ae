        <td>Yes, I do. Let me explain how I usually edit. During the first reading, I edit from a grammarian's perspective. For example, I check whether the position of conjunctions is correct, and whether the style of English is consistent. In the next reading, I make sure that the meaning is expressed accurately. It is important to make sure that the document as a whole is consistent; I check punctuation and resolve minor formatting issues, and make sure that the document is presentable. Finally, I read from the beginning and ascertain if the target readership can decipher the message of the document in a single reading.</td>

I've found this to be true in most cases. However, I usually do not make changes to an author's style of writing. One way of explaining my style of editing is to say that I admire the work of writers, and help them present their results more effectively, although there are some papers in which I cannot make head or tail of what the authors are trying to say!</td>

Once I had started, I found that it was quite difficult because there were so many instructions, and ingredient names that I was unfamiliar with. In fact, I had to refer to a couple of books and several websites to make sense of them. I finally discovered that they were recipes for African dishes!</td>

I usually get feedback from clients, and fortunately, the lady liked my work at the time; but I would rather avoid such manuscripts that lie beyond my subject area, because I cannot do them full justice. In my opinion, editors need to understand the subject thoroughly, without which it is difficult to accomplish any kind of editing.

From my own experiences, I can say that a willingness to learn and the right attitude are important if one wants to become a professional editor. I'm a member of an Editors' Association, and they've sent me many complex documents to edit. Also, recently, I've been receiving papers from Oxford University. Thus, I have been growing continually. Editors have a lifelong learning curve.
