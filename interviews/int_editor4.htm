Besides writing, I joined the Editors' Association of Canada in 1992 with the intention of extending the range of my work. I learned the ABCs of editing in workshops conducted by the association. Having written for a long time, I was familiar with editing. Since joining EAC, I have edited over 50 science articles for journal publication, written and edited over 90 job descriptions for 15 government departments, and have also edited non-fiction, novels, press releases, and articles.</td>

I have been interested in arts like painting and literature since I was a student; so, I decided to go down that road. But I'm a scientist at heart. I wrote "Stephen Hawking in Seattle" in 2006 and "Einstein and the World Year of Physics" in 2005, which are about science. Editing theses on geology rekindles many memories. People cannot be experts in all things at the same time. But geochemistry is still my home base.</td>

When I edit, I have to go back to the text, comprehend the context, extract the meaning, and try to express it in a lucid manner. In cases where I cannot guess what the author is trying to convey, which happens sometimes when English is a second language for the author, I will re-read the text several times. Usually, I will work on a hard copy first and then return to the monitor; so, editing for me is a time consuming process. In order to make work satisfying, I take the time I need.
