Next, I go through the sentences in terms of their structure and try to simplify or clarify their meaning. Finally of course, I check for any typographical errors or misspellings.</td>

          <br />
          I am always careful not to kill the author's voice. I clear up the author's meaning and make it easier for readers to understand, while keeping the author's style intact. A balance between these two seemingly contradictory goals can only be achieved by specialists who have received adequate training. And, it goes without saying that keeping oneself updated about the latest happenings in one's area of expertise at all times is a must for all good editors. </td>

          <br />
          The book is about diagnosing plant diseases; so, I spend a considerable part of the time reading related reference material. It will be of help to anybody who intends to grow plants, either in their homes or in their gardens or yards. It will help you gain knowledge of various problems experienced by plants, such as those related to their nutrition and environment, excess sunlight, too little water, attacks by insects, diseases, etc.<br />
          <br />
          I will be happy if I can continue to edit for 3-4 hours a day, and then indulge in activities like bird watching, hiking, and gardening. I would like to continue to live such a life. </td>
