After that I spent many years with a team of information workers helping researchers in animal breeding and genetics keep abreast of world literature in this field. Meanwhile I moonlighted as a copy-editor and proofreader for medical journals, but eventually gave up full-time employment to concentrate on freelance copy-editing and proofreading, which allowed me to live and work anywhere I chose. I chose to move from the UK to live in Australia, but having found the pull of family ties too strong, I am now back in the UK.</td>

Many hours were spent each week in the museum examining and drawing preserved specimens. The proportion of zoologists' time devoted to general topics such as physiology and genetics, behaviour and ecology has increased enormously since those days. I think the future of zoology will see increasing attention to matters that are of pressing concern to humanity, such as biodiversity, the biology and evolution of disease organisms, and the chemical and mathematical aspects of evolution, taking advantage of the advances that are being made in other natural and applied sciences.</td>
