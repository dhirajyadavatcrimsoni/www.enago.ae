In other words, the concept that influences them is the concept they want to believe, whether it's Keynesian, monetarist, or supply-side doctrine.  Economics should not be a discipline employed to confirm your prejudices.</td>

Personally, I would like to see economic scholars turn more attention to the link between ethics and judgment in decision-making.  We have had many discussions of decision-making under conditions of uncertainty, but--particularly given what the world has just gone through--I'm seeing no research that investigates how financial institutions could possibly have made some of the decisions they have made.  As for specific subjects, I think we will see more scholars turn to the issue of consumption taxes.  I would like to see more discussions concerning the economics of poverty.  Micro-lending is fascinating to me, and I hope to see more written about it. </td>

Without doubt, the longer assignments are the most difficult.  In addition to presenting the standard issues of forcing each sentence to pull its weight, long manuscripts inherently have more complicated structural problems.  In particular, authors tend to repeat their points, which is certain death for getting your manuscript accepted by a harried, over-worked publisher.  Longer manuscripts have a tendency to become circuitous, yet they, in particular, must be the most linear arguments.</td>
