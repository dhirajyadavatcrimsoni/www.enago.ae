        <td>Well, I think that it must be very difficult to write in one's second or third language, and I have a lot of respect for people who can do it because I know that I couldn't do it myself. Many common errors arise due to the differences between Japanese or "research" English. For example, the system of English articles (a, an, the) does not have a counterpart in Japanese, making it a very difficult part of English to learn, and it seems to be an area where a lot of errors occur. My advice is to always use an editor, more so because it is very difficult to edit your own work.

Another piece of advice is to read your work out aloud. This is to help identify errors that you cannot normally detect unless you are reading. I would suggest keeping a gap of a few hours between editing an article and then re-reading it with fresh eyes.</td>

Some people are more comfortable with editing on paper and they can't get used to editing on screen. But I find it much more efficient to edit on screen with the aid of Microsoft Word's Track Changes function. Also, if I were to make changes on paper and then go back to enter those changes on screen, it would consume more time. So, if it's a really complex assignment, I do most of the editing on screen and then print out a copy with the changes accepted and review it on paper. It is funny that there are always errors that you can catch on paper even after having done two passes on screen. A point one has to remember as an editor is that there can never be a "perfect" edit.</td>

<br />
I'll give you an example of what I'm talking about. Many times you'll see a list of clinical measurements such as blood pressure, oxygen in blood, etc. being measured followed by a list of values of the respective parameters. It is difficult for the reader to correlate these two quantities because they then have to go back to the beginning of the sentence to know what the numbers are referring to.<br /><br />

<br />
On the other hand, <a href="http://www.enago.com/editing-services.htm" title="substantive editing" class="contentlink">substantive editing</a> is also concerned with accomplishing good flow by rearranging paragraphs or sentences.

So I avoid situations in which I might be interrupted after 10 minutes and will have to go do something else and return to the edit after an interval. <br />
<br />

I do know that many editors use shortcuts, and I'm quite familiar with keyboard shortcuts, which can be assigned as and when required. For example, if I'm formatting a document, I'll set up three levels of headings with keyboard shortcuts. And then as I'm going through the document, I can apply the styles at the press of a button.</td>

So, while writing for the internet, it's important to make things shorter and use boldface and other formatting appropriately.</td>

        <td>That was part of my volunteer work for a non-profit organization, which involved writing grant applications to get funding from the government or other non-profit organizations. The principles of grant writing are similar to any other kind of writing - you should be aware of your audience and be clear and precise. It's obviously not as technical as a medical manuscript.<br />
<br />
I have also done some volunteer work as a publicist, which involved writing press releases and other communications for the media and getting them to write articles on the work of the organization. This was very different from medical writing, which is much more objective and which obviously cannot be biased. With publicity, one needs to be rather persuasive.</td>
