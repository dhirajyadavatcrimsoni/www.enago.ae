I enjoy learning about the discoveries and findings of other researchers. I chose editing as a job because it enables me to learn something new every day. I have two children - 8 and 5 years old. So I think that this job is ideal while I'm raising them, because freelance editors can organize their time in a more flexible manner. To consistently deliver work of high quality is not that easy, especially for freelancers; but it works for me because I have a solid client base.</td>

From a grammatical point of view, mistakes usually occur in word order. I frequently change the construction of several sentences and the order of words therein. Appropriate word choice is also an important factor in editing. For example, I've had to change "while" to "where" and "since" to "because" on many occasions.</td>

I recommend a really good book titled Essentials of Writing Biomedical Research Papers by Mimi Zeiger.</td>
