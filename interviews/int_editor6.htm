<br />
However, I would probably ask more content-related questions while editing a medical paper, simply because the developments in the field of medicine are tremendous, and in some areas I would not be able to follow some of the technical details. So, if there are issues involving the clarity of the presentation, I try to provide some pointers if I can, but sometimes I can only mark the unclear passage and ask the authors to try to rework it.</td>

        <td>&nbsp;</td>
        <td>Well, I agree with you. Medical papers are written in a very factual style, because the information must be conveyed clearly, using an established format. So, when preparing an article for submission to a medical journal, authors need to organize their thoughts within the particular framework of the journal and maintain a consistent style. When I edit, I always try to maintain the author's style rather than imposing my own. So, if the article is a technical paper and the author has a particular style, I will not interfere with that style. I will only try to clean up any errors and see that the rules of grammar are followed.</td>

        <td valign="top" class="vabsmiddle"><strong>You have extensive experience editing papers by non-native English speakers. What are the things that non-native speakers, especially Japanese authors, should keep in mind when they write papers in English?</strong></td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>&nbsp;</td>
        <td>One of the things I have observed is that many non-native authors write very long sentences. It's usually much easier for a reader to understand the content of a sentence when it's short and to the point. Extremely long sentences are often constructed from two or more short sentences that have been strung together. When I think the reader's comprehension of a passage would be improved, I'll suggest ways in which the author can break up these long sentences into shorter statements that build on each other to present the author's point.<br />
<br />
Some authors write long paragraphs, with lots of supporting information, at the end of which they condense their main point into a single statement. When a paragraph is filled with supporting data, this type of statement may be more effective if placed at the beginning of the paragraph. This orients the reader to the main point that will be developed in the rest of the paragraph. So, rather than starting at one point and working through a series of statements to a conclusion, it may be better to make the main point available to the reader at the beginning, and then follow with the supporting information.<br />
<br />
With Japanese authors in particular, a major issue is working with definite and indefinite articles (the, a, and an) because English articles don't have exact equivalents in Japanese. So, authors are often uncertain about which article to use in a particular instance. There are grammatical rules for using the definite versus an indefinite article, but other decisions, such as when to use and when to omit articles, are more subjective and can only be learned with experience.</td>

        <td>&nbsp;</td>
        <td>I would say that my process is always the same. I don't think of editing a document until I have a sense of the whole thing. Usually, I look through the copy to the end so that I can see where the author is starting and where he or she is trying to get to. But I am particularly careful with assignments that have really close deadlines. Sometimes I don't really understand some of the issues being addressed until I've worked halfway through the paper. Then I suddenly realize what the author is trying to say in the abstract. When I don't have much time for an edit, I try to identify the major points that are being discussed, so that I have the maximum possible information in my head when I go on to edit.</td>

Once I got out of college, I worked for a law publisher for three years. They published books on tax law, which were quite dry and not particularly interesting. <br />
<br />
When an opportunity came up to join a medical publisher, I jumped at the chance. My sister is a physician, a kidney specialist, and owing to her, I had an interest in medicine and health. So, I pursued <a href="http://www.enago.com/subject-areas.htm" title="medical  english editing" class="contentlink">medical editing</a>, and from there I went on to general science and other areas. I have worked in many capacities within publishing - I've been a production editor, a managing editor for a large textbook publisher, and a development editor. I eventually decided to work as a freelance editor because I wanted to have some control over my schedule.</td>
