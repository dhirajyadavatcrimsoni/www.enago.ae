        <td>&nbsp;</td>
        <td>In many ways the differences between medical editing and medical writing are the same as those between a substantive edit and a copyedit. To edit a manuscript properly it is very important that you have the background knowledge necessary to not only make sense of the paper in front of you but also to see where it fits in relation to other papers in the field. This knowledge helps you to determine whether the results reported and discussed in the paper are valid given the methods used. A medical writer, on the other hand, does not need the same level of experience or breadth and depth of background knowledge. However, the two are mutually beneficial as a medical writer can easily become a medical editor as he/she increases their knowledge of their field of interest and the basic writing skills gained as a writer are still used when one becomes an editor.</td>

      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>&nbsp;</td>
        <td>This is mostly intuitive. I find I tend to work from &quot;chaos&quot; into &quot;order&quot;. Generally some topic will peak my interest and I will then read up on that topic, sometimes extensively and sometimes not if I lose interest. Once I have identified a topic I am interested in and have gained a reasonable amount of knowledge about through my reading, I will plan out a suitable study, ensure that the appropriate resources and funding are available, work out a timeline, proceed with the study, analyse the results and then write the paper.     The first step when writing the paper is to gather all the relevant materials (notes, research papers, data etc.). I then try and &quot;categorize&quot; all of these and allocate them to appropriate sections of the paper e.g. &quot;Introduction&quot;, &quot;Results&quot;, &quot;Discussion&quot; etc. This can be achieved simply by writing a keyword relating to that piece of information on a piece of card and then putting each of the cards into a specific pile that represents the category. Once I have all of the information in the appropriate category, I then try and arrange it into a logical order.     I then write the first draft of the paper - generally by taking the &quot;keywords&quot; or &quot;bullet points&quot; from the cards and making these into full sentences complete with references etc. The most important things to know are that each paragraph should only discuss one topic (which should be introduced in the first sentence) and that the paper as a whole is actually an argument trying to show what your study has contributed to the field and why it is important. I generally revise the first draft myself then have someone else look at the paper before I complete the final draft and submit it.</td>

        <td>As I mentioned earlier, I think it is important for a medical editor to focus on one or two fields simply because of the increased breadth and depth of knowledge this type of specialisation can achieve. Our knowledge of the etiology and mechanisms underlying numerous medical conditions is growing daily and this growth is often due to rapid improvements in technology. It is important for an editor to have an understanding of the terminology surrounding these new technologies as well as of the techologies themselves in order for him/her to be able to correctly analyze whether the methodology used in a study is valid for achieving its stated aims. Without sufficient background knowledge of the &quot;norms&quot; of the field, an editor will not be able to complete a thorough edit of a manuscript.</td>

It is also important to target the right journal so reading a number of journals is important to see not only what types of papers those journals publish but also the style of writing they use.    I think the Japanese researchers make similar mistakes to most non-native English speakers e.g. the incorrect use of articles and prepositions in particular. I have also noted that sometimes they mix up `l' and `r' e.g. they will write `proriferate' instead of `proliferate'. I would like to point out though that generally their standard of English is good - it may not be &quot;native&quot;-level English but it is usually good enough for me to understand what they are trying to say and I am sure that my Japanese would be far more incomprehensible!</td>
